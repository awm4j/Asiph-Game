The Asiph Game
==========

An education game for the koding hackathon.

Introduction
=======
You are a world renown assassin. You awake in a cell, unsure of how you got here. You feel groggy. A doctor enters. You clumsily knock him out and rush out the open door. Now it's up to you to fight your way out of the hell that you're in.

We are using Phaser.js, Bootstrap, and Font Awesome.
