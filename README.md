Introduction
=======
You are a world renown assassin. You awake in a cell, unsure of how you got here. You feel groggy. A doctor enters. You clumsily knock him out and rush out the open door. Now it's up to you to fight your way out of the hell that you're in.

Chapter 1
=======
Get down the hall as fast as you can, avoid the junk in the halls. Use the arrow keys (w,a,s,d) to move.

Chapter 2
=======
You come across some guards, attack them using k.

Chapter 3
=======
You're feeling better, but the enemy is close behind. Perhaps you can try some advanced moves. Create a function to move twice as fast.

Chapter 4
=======
Oh NO! You ran into a lot of guards, pause time using p and create a function that attacks faster.

=======
You have a long maze to traverse, perhaps writing a function would help speed things up.
